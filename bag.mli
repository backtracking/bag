(** Bags (aka multisets).

    A bag is merely a map that binds each element to its multiplicity
    in the bag (see function [occ] below).

    All operations over bags are purely applicative (no side-effects).
    Bags are internally implemented with AVLs (from module [Map])
    and consequently operations such as [occ], [mem], [add], or [remove]
    take time logarithmic in the size (i.e. number of distinct elements)
    of the bag.

    Caveat: There is no unicity of representation. Consequently, the
    polymorphic equality [(=)] must not be used on bags. Functions
    [compare] and [equal] are provided to compare bags.

    Similarly, the polymorphic hash function [Hashtbl.hash] must not be
    used on bags. If one intends to use bags as hash table heys, a suitable
    hash function must be defined, with something like

    {[
      let hash b =
        fold (fun x n h -> 5003 * (5003 * h + hash x) + n) b 0
    ]}

    where [hash] is a suitable hash function for the bag elements.
